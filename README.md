### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Manuel Etchegaray, i'm an Argentine software developer! :shipit:


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some open source projects:
- [ToolDB](https://github.com/Manwe-777/tool-db): A decentralized database and data sharing for peer to peer applications running mainly on the browser, without central servers!
- [MTG Arena Tool](https://github.com/mtgatool/mtgatool-desktop): A desktop overlay and companion app for Magic the Gathering: Arena, able to run seamlessly in the browser; "MTG Arena Tool is a collection browser, a deck tracker and a statistics manager for MTG Arena."

I'm a crypto and web3 enthusiast at heart, decentralize everything! :collision:

- Typescript / Javascript
- React
